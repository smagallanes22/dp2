HOW TO Translate dragonpilot
--

If you would like to help to translate dragonpilot into your native language, please:
1. Contact dragonpilot team to generate language files for translation.

2. Start translation, there will be 2 files: (locale = your language code)
    * <openpilot>/selfdrive/assets/locales/**locale**/LC_MESSAGES/events.po
      * This is for alerts messages. (e.g. on road warning messages) 
    * <openpilot>/selfdrive/ui/translations/**locale**.ts
      * This is for UI. (e.g. settings pages)

   We recommended to use a proper editor such as TextMate (mac) / notepad++ (win) / Intellij pyCharm.


3. Submit a PR for your translation.

4. dragonpilot team will review your PR and add it in the next release.
